In spring 2022, I took a class called Mapping Information at RISD in the Graphic Design department, where we were tasked with a few projects. The projects were to document a process that had at least 10 different steps, to showcase a narrative in a way that wasn't storyboarded, and to create a country infographic with many charts and graphics.
