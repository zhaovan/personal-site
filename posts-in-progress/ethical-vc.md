In 2020, US venture capital funds have raised a combined [$69.1 billion in 2020](https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/us-vc-fundraising-hits-record-69b-in-2020-after-a16z-closes-two-mega-funds), the most amount of money ever to date. And yet, we've seen cases of numerous scandals, such as [WeWork](https://newrepublic.com/article/160299/wework-book-review-billion-dollar-loser-rise-fall-adam-neumann),[ Theranos](https://www.businessinsider.com/the-history-of-silicon-valley-unicorn-theranos-and-ceo-elizabeth-holmes-2018-5), and most recently,[ David Dobrik's recent sexual assault cases](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-56536392). And yet, while venture funds such as[ Spark Capital](https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/21/spark-capital-decides-to-sever-all-ties-with-david-dobriks-dispo-app-weeks-after-leading-investment/) and[ Seven Seven Six](https://www.eonline.com/news/1251112/alexis-ohanian-addresses-troubling-david-dobrik-allegations-amid-dispo-app-investment) recently announced their move to sever all ties and forward all profits that they make from the company, there’s a lack of accountability on those that fund the future.

In essence, venture capital is investing large forms of capital into businesses or ideas with high risk. In the 1980s,[ this usually came as a result of companies that had high technical risk and low market risk](http://reactionwheel.net/2015/01/80s-vc.html), companies that were extremely difficult to pull off under traditional methods of financing and required the buy in from those that usually had money. As the dotcom boom passed and[ software became the basis for every company,](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460) more and more startups are spinning out. And yet, everyday, news articles constantly pump out problems and scandals that these companies run into.[ Uber and Lyft still list drivers as contract workers](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/uber-lyft-face-landmark-lawsuit-over-gig-worker-classification-n1200526),[ Airbnb drives out local tourism](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/12/profiteers-killing-airbnb-erode-communities), and every day, the profits and returns go back to line the pockets of venture capitalists who squabble over Twitter over [Patagonia vests](https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1380565150441205762) and [Miami](https://twitter.com/zebulgar/status/1334991230531301376).

Venture has increasingly become a preference laid business. The problems that [VC’s see in the world](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/01/juicero-silicon-valley-shutting-down) are extremely divergent from those that solve people problems, especially those that build in consumer focused spaces. Given the [demographic makeup](https://hbr.org/2020/08/institutional-investors-must-help-close-the-race-and-gender-gaps-in-venture-capital#:~:text=Proof%20is%20in%20the%20numbers,positions%20at%20venture%20capital%20firms.) and lack of due [diligence process](https://twitter.com/Jai__Malik/status/1359630443063181312), it’s time to rethink how venture operates as a system. Instead of the motto of "moving fast and breaking things", the industry should focus more on "moving forward and backing things".

## **On Moving Forward**

If we're creating a better world through venture investing (and holding ourselves to a higher standard), the question becomes: how do we design an ethical framework that integrates with our current due diligence process? One idea, speculative design, is inspired by the world of speculative fiction. Speculative design is the practice of addressing big societal issues with design processes and systems. It's about imagining the\_ what if's \_of the world. In Ivica Mitrovic’s Intro to Speculative Design Practice, he states that “by speculating, designers re-think alternative products, systems and worlds.” Designer and teacher at the Royal College of Art, James Auger, [says that speculative design](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14626268.2013.767276) (1) moves away from the constraints of the commercial practice (steered by the market); (2) uses fiction and speculates on future products, services, systems and worlds, thus reflectively examining the role and impact of new technologies on everyday life; (3) and initiates dialogue between experts (scientists, engineers and designers) and users of new technologies (the audience).

For example, if we take Uber as a case study, early investors were excited about the prospect of mobilization. That is, how do we create ways for people to move from A to B? However, what investors failed to consider, and what would've been obvious, is what would the world look like once Uber had taken scale. What would happen to taxi drivers? And, in an industry where [25.6% of taxi drivers/chauffeurs are Black and a large percentage of drivers are POC](https://datausa.io/profile/soc/taxi-drivers-chauffeurs#demographics), it’s even more significant to consider how these new products would directly affect marginalized communities. Spending more time thinking about the ethical implications and perhaps less on market size and growth hacking, could lead us to help build a better future that we want.

It’s easy to look at Uber and these other tech giants and say that hindsight is 2020, that it’s easy to look at something and criticize it instead of thinking about it in advance. Instead, to illustrate how this process might be done on an up and coming company, let’s assume a hypothetical product. One space that has been exploding in recent years is [audio spaces](https://a16z.com/2020/12/07/social-strikes-back-audio/). Besides the immediate issues around accessibility that arise from the Deaf community, one question to ask during an interview with a founder is to ask about their moderation tools. In a world filled with the potential for deepfakes and stitched together audio recordings, how does the founder think about the future of fake news? At this point, if we’re talking early stage, it’s honestly too early for a coherent response. But hearing how the founder responds to this type of question, one that might come dreaming around a speculative future, could give insight to how they think around these types of topics and give the investor insight to how they think around building products.

The other key question that we should consider during the diligence process is: should this product or technology even exist? How does the creation of this good or service positively and negatively affect the people in the world? In a recent article on problem solving, researchers found that [people are more likely to consider solutions that add features, rather than subtract](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00592-0). As innovators in the world and investors in the world, the default always seems to be that we should be creating, that we should be wanting, that we should be manifesting. But as humans, we should recognize that impulse. No matter what product or service is being created, whether it’s the next TikTok or Facebook, sometimes we need to take that step back and reevaluate. And in an era where deals are closing faster than ever, [it’s even more important to have a process on how venture funds should be doing deals.](https://twitter.com/AmandaMGoetz/status/1380499131391737859)

## **On (Who’s) Backing Things**

From the numbers, it's clear that tech and venture is still a rich white man's game. Even in the products that are created, it’s blatantly obvious that these products weren’t built with marginalized communities in mind ([bus](https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/07/30/ebussy-electricbands-german-bussy-gay-twitter-reaction-funny-viral-meme/), [Slack’s DM’s](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22348126/slack-connect-direct-messaging-dm-company-feature), [Intel’s Bleep](https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373290/intel-bleep-ai-powered-abuse-toxicity-gaming-filters)). This goes even further given the discourse surrounding the[ recent tech backlash towards SF](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2021/03/vc-lives-matter-silicon-valley-investors-want-to-oust-san-franciscos-reformist-da/), that there's a sense of entitlement coming from those who have benefitted from being at the top of the system of power. Those that always have had opportunities given to them. These benefits have been quantified by researchers who studied 1 million US patent holders and looked at their parents’ income. Low-income students in the top 5% in math were no more likely to become inventors than below-average math students from affluent families.[ However, if women, minorities, and children from low-income families were to invent at the same rate as white men from families with incomes in the top 20%, the rate of innovation in America would quadruple.](https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/documents/SUCCESSAct-Bell.pdf) As investors with decision making power, we have an obligation to society to back ALL founders, especially those with underrepresented backgrounds.

In creating a more diverse future, we should hold both sides of the deal to a higher standard. There's been a push on the founder side, organizations such as[ Founders For Change](https://www.foundersforchange.org/) are rising up to create a more diverse tech scene backed by empathetic founders that create for a better world. But as long as those who have the money continue to invest in problematic ideas, we will continue to have predatory startups that take advantage of marginalized groups as they continue to grow at "all costs".

## **Conclusion**

Altogether, the tech and venture scene has a long way to go. But I’m optimistic of a new wave of technologists, founders, and investors, those that are actively centralizing marginalized voices and thinking about the communities that people are building for. As we’ve seen movements in the [technology](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Software-Internet-Justice-AfroNet/dp/0190863846) and [design](https://designjustice.org/) world towards a more just future, venture capital can take some of the best of those movements and incorporate it in its own processes. Venture capital is not an investment vehicle that can be completely divorced from the policies, people, and societies that it affects. Thus, the people who inhabit and build it cannot be either.
