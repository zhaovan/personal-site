      'I think this quote from one of my favorite books, Educated, sums it up pretty well: "The decisions I made after that moment were not the ones she would have made.

          Before working together, I think it's helpful to understand things
          that I value and care about. As such, here are some things that you
          should know about me:
          <h1>Principles</h1>
          {principles.map((principle, i) => {
            const quote = principle.blurb.split(':')[1];
            return (
              <div key={i}>
                <h3>{principle.principle}</h3>
                <p>{principle.blurb}</p>
              </div>
            );
          })}
          <h1>Other Notes:</h1>
          <ul>
            {notes.map((note, i) => {
              return (
                <li key={i} style={{ marginTop: '1%' }}>
                  {note.statement}
                </li>
              );
            })}
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <Footer />
    </div>
  );
}
