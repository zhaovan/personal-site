                I fundamentally believe that technology, used judiciously, can
                build a better future. I'm in my era of hobby and exploration
                and am currently obsessed with film photography, short stories
                and poetry, and mixology. Catch me hanging out at random coffee
                shops, hammocking at the top of a mountain, or napping at home
                with my dog.

                Some of the main questions that drive the work that I'm most

                <li>
                  In what ways can we use technology (such as GPT-3) to push the
                  limits of creativity?
                </li>
                <li>
                  How can technology aid collective knowledge, collaboration,
                  and communication?
                </li>
                <li>
                  In what ways can we push formal boundaries of print, the
                  internet, and video games to develop interactive experiences?
                </li>
                <li>
                  How do the stories and lived experiences of families,
                  represented in media and culture, change our notion of self?
