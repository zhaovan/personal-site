Hey friends!

I wrote some short pieces for [Visions Magazine](https://visions-mag.com), an Asian American Literary Arts Magazine for Brown/RISD students in the Fall of 2021.

### The Arrival

When I was six, we flew to visit you in Beijing. My arms, like the wings of plane, lifted up for takeoff and bounced up and down as we soared through the skies. We touched down late that night. It was 11:30pm, but you were there waiting for me, holding an umbrella and a bag of freshly purchased peaches and bagged milk from the corner shop. I grinned so wide as I ran over. You chuckled, cooing as you handed me a peach and I took it into my pudgy hands as I bit into the soft, juicy flesh. The liquid dribbled over my hands and onto your jacket but we didn’t have a care in the world. In that moment, our family was whole.

When I was twelve, you flew to visit me in Seattle. It had been years! I hadn’t been practicing the rhymes and songs you taught me the last time we talked on the phone. 小白兔... I started, trailing off as I forgot the word. The words flew out of my mouth like stones being tossed in a river, garbled and messy. 宝贝，没关系 you said. I sighed in relief and discomfort. To you, it was never a problem. You were happy to see me! To spend time with your grandsons in a different country. You hobbled over to the kitchen, legs no longer as strong and steady as they were when you picked me up that last time. 要吃苹果吗？I could never say no.

Now that I’m twenty one, I have regrets. When was the last time I had seen you? You called me once over WeChat, but that was so long ago. You apologized profusely because you couldn’t send me a gift. 奶奶，没关系, I texted back, my fingers clumsily spelling the characters. I waited for a bit, but there wasn’t a response. Oh well, I thought, you’ll respond. You always do.

### 哥哥

Do you remember asking me if I was gay and I started to panic and simply said that I was not but deep down I knew that it was a lie that I had discovered three years earlier but was still coming to terms with and you told me that it was okay if I was?

Do you remember calling me late at night because I had posted on social media about how unhappy I was and you sent me dog pictures to cheer me up because you knew that I was struggling and wanted to know that I was okay and I said I was fine?

Do you remember visiting me during a random weekend since you said you had some free time even though you were working 100 hour work weeks and were clearly so stressed and yet wanted to see the smile on my face as you brought my favorite cake from NYC and you told me that it reminded you of me?

Because I did.
