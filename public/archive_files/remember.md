Hey friends!

Here's a piece from my English class on memory that I particularly enjoyed. Cheers!

### Days Gone By

I remember the days when the only worry I had in the world was figuring out if I wanted fudge brownies or key lime pie.

I remember when my father held me up on his shoulder, my pudgy, baby fat filled arms gripped the peanut butter sandwich as if my life depended on it. It had.

I remember holding the couch pillow under my butt, the soft cushion a sled, as I slid down the stairs in our house.

I remember the day that our parakeets got loose in the house. They were perched up on my brother’s window, their fluorescent red and golden feathers ruffled from flying. They then pooped on my brother.

I remember the electric jolt I felt when my mother told me that we were moving across the country for her new job. I didn’t understand, couldn’t understand as the big strange men took our posessions away. All I remember is the slamming and taping of boxes, muffled through the closet I was in.

I remember tugging at my shirt at the new school. I would pinch and tug and shift and pinch until the shirt hung loose on my body so no one could see how heavy I was.

I remember the first time my father asked me which girls I liked in class. I replied that I liked everyone, to which my father told people that I had multiple girlfriends and that I could choose between them.

I remember that I felt awful after hearing this the first time he said it. And that I didn’t even like girls.

I remember a dream that I had where I came out to my friends and they laughed and laughed and laughed until I woke up in a cold sweat.

I remember a dream where I came out to my parents and they cried and yelled and screamed and roared, until I cried too. Except it wasn’t a dream. At least partially.

I remember the first time I saw a man naked in the streets. It was at the Seattle Pride parade in 2018 and I had just turned 18, the legal age of consent. I was holding a sign, brightly rainbow colored, saying I was “just there to pet dogs.”

I remember staring at myself in the mirror, wishing that I looked like all the men I saw on television with chiseled bodies. Or like the men on the magazines I had kept in my closet. Or like any man that wasn’t me.

I remember my parents telling me about their experience leaving China during the Cultural Revolution. How they used education as an escape method, sending hundreds of letters to grad programs hoping they would hear back. How both of them got in.

I remember my mom telling me about how she gave up everything to come here. Her home, her family, her hobbies.

I remember how I felt when they sent me off into the world. A bird spreading its wings. Or maybe, a parakeet. Ready to fly.
